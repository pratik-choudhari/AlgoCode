# Fibonacci Sequence

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is calculated by adding up the previous two numbers.

For eg : 8 + 13 = 21 
         13 + 21 = 34  and so on...


The next sequence in the above example will be : 21 + 34 = 55 

## What does this code do ?

This program will calculate the sum of the sequence, of which ever number is provided. 

For eg: n = 5
