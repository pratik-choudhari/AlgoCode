Circular singly linked list is a type of data structure that is made up of nodes that are created using self referential structures. Each of these nodes contain two parts, namely the data and the reference to the next list node.

Only the reference to the first list node is required to access the whole linked list. This is known as the head. The last node in the list points to head or first node of the list. That is the reason this is known as a circular linked list.

# Problem Statement:- 
All operations like insertion, deletion and traversal by using a circular linkedlist

# output:-
The circular linked list created is as follows:

10==>20==>30==>40==>50==>60==>10

The node with data 10 is deleted from the list

Circular linked list after deleting 10 is as follows:

20==>30==>40==>50==>60==>20
